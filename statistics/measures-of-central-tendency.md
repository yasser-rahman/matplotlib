# Measures of Central Tendency

## Random Variable X

  
   **X** = {xi : i = 0, 1, 2, â€¦, n} where **n** is the sample size of that random variable

## Mean \(X\) - or Expectation of x - E\(X\)

The mean of X has a very interesting property as follows:

## Median of X

To get the median of X, we shall sort it ascendingly.   
if n is odd, then the median is the central value of the ordered values.  
if n is even, then the median is the average of the two values in the middle.

## Mode of X

The mode of a random variable X is the most frequent value in this data set.  
The mode is the peak of the distribution chart of X.
