# Shifting and Scaling of A dataset

## Shifting \(addition and subtraction\)

Whether we add a constant to each data point or subtract a constant from each data point, the mean, median, and mode will change by the same amount, but the range and IQR will stay the same.



## Scaling \(multiplication and division\)

If we multiply our data set by a constant value or divide our data set by a constant value, then the mean, median, mode, range, and IQR will all be scaled by the same amount.
