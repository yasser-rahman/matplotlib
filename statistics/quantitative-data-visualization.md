# Quantitative Data Visualization

## Histogram

A histogram is just like a bar graph, except that we collect the data into buckets or bins, and then sketch a bar for each bucket. Each bucket needs to be the same size, or width, so that theyâ€™re capable of holding the same amount of data.

## The Five-number Summary

The five-number summary, also called the five-figure summary, for any set of data will include the minimum and maximum values, the median, and Q1 and Q3 for the data set.
