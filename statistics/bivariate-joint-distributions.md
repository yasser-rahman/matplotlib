# Bivariate Joint Distributions

## Joint Distribution

A joint distribution is a table of percentages similar to a relative frequency table. The difference is that, in a joint distribution, we show the distribution of one set of data against the distribution of another set of data.

## Marginal Distribution

Think of a marginal distribution as the Total column or the Total row in this joint distribution. It’s like only having one of the distributions, not both. So if we only had the distribution of weight lost, we’d have just the totals along the bottom of the table.
