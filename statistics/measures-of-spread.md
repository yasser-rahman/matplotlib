# Measures of Spread

## Range of X

Range is the difference between the max value and the min value in that dataset  
Range\(x\) = Max\(X\) - Min \(X\)



## IQR \(X\)

We ascendingly order the data points from x1 to xn. Then the median is the value of X where at the middle of that data points \(50%\). This value is called the Q2 \(second quantile\). Then we subdivide each segment \(the right segment before Q2 and the left segment after Q2\)  into two halves. The median of the right segment is called Q1 \(25%\) quantile and the middle of the left segment is called Q3 \(75%\) quantile.  The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
