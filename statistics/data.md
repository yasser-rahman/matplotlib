# Data

#### The Single piece of information:

The most elementary piece of information consists of a tag \( Variable name\) and a value. When we say 95.0, here we cannot say that we have a price of information. But we say a height of 95.0, here we have expressed a piece of data.

## Classification of Data Variables:

Data variables could be of two forms:

* **Categorical Type**

This data type has no numerical value and sometimes is called qualitative data types. 

* **Quantitative Type**

## Level of Measurements

  
 There are four levels of data measurement: nominal,

ordinal, interval, and ratio.

**•** Things like favorite food, colors, names, and “yes” or “no”

responses have a **nominal** scale of measurement. Only categorical

data can be measured with a nominal scale.

**•** Categorial data can also be **ordinal**. This type of data can be

ordered. The top three national parks in California is an example of ordinal data. Or, for example, when we ask a group of people

about how they liked their trip, we may get responses like

“awesome,” “good,” “satisfactory,” or “terrible,” which follow an

order from best to worst.

**•** Data measured using an **interval** scale can be ordered like ordinal

data. But interval data also gives us a known interval between

measurements. For example, temperature is measured using an

interval scale, because we can understand the exact interval of

difference between 50 and 60 degrees.

**•** Data measured using a **ratio** scale is just like interval scale data,

except that ratio scale data has a starting point, or absolute zero.

Whereas interval data like temperature can have negative and

positive values, things like time, height, and weight are examples

of ratio scale data because those measures can never be negative.
