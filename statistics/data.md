# Data Classification

#### The Single piece of information:

The most elementary piece of information consists of a tag \( Variable name\) and a value. When we say 95.0, here we cannot say that we have a price of information. But we say a height of 95.0, here we have expressed a piece of data.

## Classification of Data Variables:

Data variables could be of two forms:

* **Categorical Type**

This data type has no numerical value and sometimes is called qualitative data types. 

* **Quantitative Type**

## Level of Measurements

**•** **Nominal:** This data has no order and thus only give names and labels to various categories.

Things like favorite food, colors, names, and “yes” or “no”

**•** **Ordinal**. This type of data has an order, but the interval between measurements is not meaningful.

**•** **Interval:** This data type has meaningful intervals between measurements. But there is no true starting point \(zero\). For example, temperature is measured using an interval scale, because we can understand the exact interval of the difference between 50 and 60 degrees.

**•** **Ratio:** this data type has the highest level of measurement. Raios between measurements as well as intervals are meaningful because there is a true starting point. Time, height, and weight are examples of ratio scale data because those measures can never be negative.

> Just remeber that for ratio data measurement allows us to compare ratios between two individuals. like Sam is almost 1.2 taller than Hans. While this cannot happen with interval measrements. For example, we cannot say that the measured temprature in Cairo is double than what measured in San Fransisco.
