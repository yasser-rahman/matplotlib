# Data

#### The Single piece of information:

The most elementary piece of information consists of a tag \( Variable name\) and a value. When we say 95.0, here we cannot say that we have a price of information. But we say a height of 95.0, here we have expressed a piece of data.

## Classification of Data Variables:

Data variables could be of two forms:

* **Categorical Type**

This data type has no numerical value and sometimes is called qualitative data types. 

* **Quantitative Type**

## Level of Measurements

**•** **Nomianl:**Things like favorite food, colors, names, and “yes” or “no”

**•** O**rdinal**. This type of data can be

ordered. The top three national parks in California is an example of ordinal data. Or, for example, when we ask a group of people

about how they liked their trip, we may get responses like

“awesome,” “good,” “satisfactory,” or “terrible,” which follow an

order from best to worst.

**•** **Interval** scale can be ordered like ordinal data. But interval data also gives us a known interval between measurements. For example, temperature is measured using an interval scale, because we can understand the exact interval of difference between 50 and 60 degrees.

**•** **Ratio** scale is just like interval scale data, except that ratio scale data has a starting point, or absolute zero.

Whereas interval data like temperature can have negative and

positive values, things like time, height, and weight are examples

of ratio scale data because those measures can never be negative.

> Just remeber that for ratio data measurement allows us to compare ratios between two individuals. like Sam is almost 1.2 taller than Hans. While this cannot happen with interval measrements. For example, we cannot say that the measured temprature in Cairo is double than what measured in San Fransisco.
